## Codebase Patterns
- Server code lives in `server/` directory with its own package.json
- Server uses ts-node for development, tsc for production builds
- Server runs on PORT env var (default 3001)
- Run `npm run typecheck` in server/ to verify types

## 2026-02-01 - US-001
- What was implemented: Express server with TypeScript setup, health check endpoint
- Files changed:
  - server/package.json (new)
  - server/tsconfig.json (new)
  - server/index.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Server uses cors middleware for cross-origin requests
  - Gotchas encountered: None
  - Useful context: Health check at GET /api/health returns { status: 'ok' }
