## Codebase Patterns
- Server code lives in `server/` directory with its own package.json
- Server uses ts-node for development, tsc for production builds
- Server runs on PORT env var (default 3001)
- Run `npm run typecheck` in server/ to verify types
- Database module in `server/db/index.ts` exports `initializeDatabase()` and `getDatabase()`
- SQLite database stored at `server/data/characters.db` (gitignored)
- Use nanoid v3 for generating unique IDs (CommonJS compatible)

## 2026-02-01 - US-001
- What was implemented: Express server with TypeScript setup, health check endpoint
- Files changed:
  - server/package.json (new)
  - server/tsconfig.json (new)
  - server/index.ts (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Server uses cors middleware for cross-origin requests
  - Gotchas encountered: None
  - Useful context: Health check at GET /api/health returns { status: 'ok' }
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-002
- What was implemented: SQLite database setup with better-sqlite3, characters table schema
- Files changed:
  - server/db/schema.sql (new) - characters table schema
  - server/db/index.ts (new) - database initialization module
  - server/index.ts (modified) - added initializeDatabase() call
  - server/package.json (modified) - added better-sqlite3 dependency
  - .gitignore (modified) - added server/data/ to ignore database files
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Use `getDatabase()` from server/db/index.ts to access the db instance
  - Gotchas encountered: Run initializeDatabase() before any routes that need DB access
  - Useful context: Schema uses CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS for idempotent initialization
---

## 2026-02-01 - US-003
- What was implemented: POST /api/characters endpoint for creating characters
- Files changed:
  - server/index.ts (modified) - added POST /api/characters route with nanoid ID generation
  - server/package.json (modified) - added nanoid dependency
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Use nanoid v3 (CommonJS compatible) for ID generation
  - Gotchas encountered: Validate request body exists and is a non-empty object before processing
  - Useful context: POST returns 201 with { id, ...characterData }, 400 if body invalid
