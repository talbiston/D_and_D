## Codebase Patterns
- Typecheck using `npx tsc -b` (no typecheck script in package.json)
- Lint using `npm run lint` - pre-existing lint errors in DiceRoller.tsx and DarkModeContext.tsx are known issues
- SpeciesAncestryOption in src/types/index.ts is used for species-specific choices (e.g., Dragonborn draconic ancestry, Elven Lineage)

## 2026-02-01 20:46 CST - US-001
- What was implemented: Added four optional fields to SpeciesAncestryOption interface for Elven Lineage support
- Files changed: src/types/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SpeciesAncestryOption is used for species ancestry choices - it now supports speedOverride, darkvisionOverride, cantrip, and leveledSpells
  - The codebase has pre-existing lint errors that are not blockers for commits
  - Use `npx tsc -b` for typechecking since there's no typecheck script
