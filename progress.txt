## Codebase Patterns
- Typecheck using `npx tsc -b` (no typecheck script in package.json)
- Lint using `npm run lint` - pre-existing lint errors in DiceRoller.tsx and DarkModeContext.tsx are known issues
- SpeciesAncestryOption in src/types/index.ts is used for species-specific choices (e.g., Dragonborn draconic ancestry, Elven Lineage)

## 2026-02-01 20:46 CST - US-001
- What was implemented: Added four optional fields to SpeciesAncestryOption interface for Elven Lineage support
- Files changed: src/types/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SpeciesAncestryOption is used for species ancestry choices - it now supports speedOverride, darkvisionOverride, cantrip, and leveledSpells
  - The codebase has pre-existing lint errors that are not blockers for commits
  - Use `npx tsc -b` for typechecking since there's no typecheck script

## 2026-02-01 20:48 CST - US-002
- What was implemented: Added ancestry data for Elven Lineages (Drow, High Elf, Wood Elf) to Elf species
- Files changed: src/data/species.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Elf species in species.ts now has an ancestry field with choiceName 'Elven Lineage' and three options
  - Drow: darkvisionOverride=120, cantrip='Dancing Lights', leveledSpells=[{level:3, Faerie Fire}, {level:5, Darkness}]
  - High Elf: cantrip='Prestidigitation', leveledSpells=[{level:3, Detect Magic}, {level:5, Misty Step}]
  - Wood Elf: speedOverride=35, cantrip='Druidcraft', leveledSpells=[{level:3, Longstrider}, {level:5, Pass Without Trace}]
  - Follow existing ancestry patterns in species.ts (e.g., Dragonborn, Gnome, Tiefling, Goliath, Aasimar)
