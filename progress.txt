## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for typecheck (no "typecheck" npm script)
- Icon files stored in public/icons/{classes,species}/ with lowercase-hyphenated filenames
- SVGs use black fill by default (need inversion for dark mode)

## 2026-02-01 17:16 - US-001
- **What was implemented:** Set up icon directory structure and copied all SVG files
- **Files changed:**
  - Created public/icons/classes/ with 13 class SVGs (artificer.svg through wizard.svg)
  - Created public/icons/species/ with 11 species SVGs (tiefling.svg, forest-gnome.svg, etc.)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Typecheck command is `npx tsc --noEmit` (no npm script for it)
  - Source icons were in scratchpad with "Class Icon - Name.svg" and "Race Icon - Name.svg" naming
  - Species icons use lowercase-hyphenated format (e.g., "forest-gnome", "air-genasi")

## 2026-02-01 17:20 - US-002
- **What was implemented:** Added .icon-invertible CSS class for dark mode icon support
- **Files changed:**
  - src/index.css - Added .icon-invertible class with filter transition and dark mode invert
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The project uses Tailwind v4 with `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax
  - Dark mode is controlled by `.dark` class on parent elements
  - CSS additions go at the top of index.css after the import, before print styles

## 2026-02-01 17:25 - US-003
- **What was implemented:** Created ClassIcon component for displaying class icons
- **Files changed:**
  - src/components/ClassIcon.tsx - New component with className and optional size props
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Components use `export default` pattern
  - Use `as const` for string literal arrays to enable type narrowing
  - Component returns null for unsupported values (graceful degradation)

## 2026-02-01 17:35 - US-004
- **What was implemented:** Created SpeciesIcon component for displaying species icons
- **Files changed:**
  - src/components/SpeciesIcon.tsx - New component with species and optional size props
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Species names need conversion to lowercase-hyphenated format (e.g., "Forest Gnome" -> "forest-gnome")
  - Use `.replace(/\s+/g, '-')` to convert spaces to hyphens
  - Follow same pattern as ClassIcon for consistency

## 2026-02-01 17:45 - US-005
- **What was implemented:** Added class and species icons to character sheet header
- **Files changed:**
  - src/pages/CharacterSheetPage.tsx - Added ClassIcon and SpeciesIcon imports and usage in header
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Species/class display is around line 1166-1170 in the header paragraph element
  - Use `<span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1">` to wrap icon and text for alignment
  - Icons are 20px size in header for good visibility without being overwhelming
  - The header structure: Level Up button, species name, ancestry (optional), class name, subclass (optional)

## 2026-02-01 17:50 - US-006
- **What was implemented:** Added class and species icons to home page character cards
- **Files changed:**
  - src/pages/HomePage.tsx - Added ClassIcon and SpeciesIcon imports and usage in character card display
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Character cards are in a grid at lines 118-146
  - Character info paragraph is at line 131-133 showing "Level X Species Class"
  - Use 18px icons for cards (smaller than header's 20px for proportional sizing)
  - Same inline-flex pattern works here for icon+text alignment
  - Manual browser verification needed (no browser tools available)

## 2026-02-01 18:00 - US-007
- **What was implemented:** Added class icon to character creation page
- **Files changed:**
  - src/pages/CharacterCreatePage.tsx - Added ClassIcon import and display next to class dropdown
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Class dropdown is around line 872-893 in CharacterCreatePage.tsx
  - Wrapped dropdown in flex container with icon for inline alignment
  - Used 32px size for prominent display during character creation
  - Icon only renders when characterClass is selected (truthy check)
  - Manual browser verification needed (no browser tools available)
