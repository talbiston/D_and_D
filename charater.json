        "backstory": "Alrodor Sylvaeren was born into a venerable High Elf lineage known more for record-keeping and historical stewardship than heroics. His family served for generations as curators of memory—maintaining chronicles, star charts, and spell indices that stretched back millennia. From his earliest years, Therenel was taught that knowledge itself is a sacred duty, not merely a tool for power.\n\nWhile other elven youths trained with blade and bow, Therenel gravitated toward quiet halls and dust-heavy archives. He learned early how fragile truth could be—how history changed depending on who held the pen. This realization sparked a lifelong fixation: what had been forgotten, erased, or deliberately hidden.\n\nLife as a Scholar\n\nTherenel was formally inducted into the Aetheryn Conclave, a prestigious arcane institution devoted to cataloging magical phenomena. His role was not to innovate spells, but to understand their origins—to annotate, compare, and cross-reference magic across cultures and eras.\n\nYears of disciplined study honed his intellect and patience. He became adept at:\n\nIdentifying obscure symbols and languages\n\nReconstructing incomplete rituals\n\nTracking conflicting historical accounts\n\nYet his greatest discovery came not from brilliance, but from persistence.\n\nThe Unanswered Question\n\nWhile researching pre-Elven magical practices, Therenel uncovered repeated references to a “Foundational Error”—a supposed flaw in early arcane theory that modern spellcasting quietly compensated for, but never corrected. Every source mentioning it ended abruptly, redacted or destroyed.\n\nWhen Therenel presented his findings, the Conclave dismissed them as apocrypha. Some senior scholars advised him—kindly, but firmly—to let dead questions remain buried.\n\nTherenel could not.\n\nDeparture from the Archives\n\nDenied official funding and access, Therenel chose a different path. He left the Conclave not in disgrace, but in professional isolation—still respected, quietly ignored. Armed with copied notes, a meticulously maintained spellbook, and a mind sharpened by centuries of study, he turned to the wider world.\n\nAncient ruins, lost libraries, and forgotten civilizations offered what institutions would not: raw, unfiltered truth.\n\nPersonality & Scholar Traits (2024-Friendly)\n\nPersonality: Thoughtful, precise, and habitually curious; tends to narrate his own reasoning aloud.\n\nIdeal: Knowledge should be preserved and shared, not controlled.\n\nBond: His research notes—organized, indexed, and guarded with his life.\n\nFlaw: Has difficulty abandoning a line of inquiry, even when it puts him at risk.\n\nWhy He Adventures\n\nTherenel adventures not for glory, but for answers. Each dungeon is a library waiting to be cataloged. Each artifact is a footnote in a story unfinished.\n\nHe believes the world is built atop forgotten assumptions—and if the Foundational Error truly exists, correcting it could reshape magic itself… or unravel it.\n\nEither way, someone must finish the work.",
